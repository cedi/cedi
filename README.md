## :wave: Cedric Kienzler - @cedi

Hi, I'm cedi.

My current work as Senior Site Reliability Engineer focuses on making [iMKE](imke.cloud) more reliable and move it forward.

I do fun stuff with K8s, I love Go and do a lot of work on [@open-infrastructure](open-infrastructure.de).

## What's important to me?

* Be excellent to each other
* Follow the [80/20 principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) whenever possible
  * Don't waste 80% of your time, implementing the top 20% when the the customer is already happy with the 80% you delivered in 20% of your time
* Focus on focus on the fundamentals rather than fancy cutting-edge stuff
* Get your good damn service reliability hirarchy right
  * Don't waste time implementing fancy features when the lower part of your pyramid can't support it
