Hi, I'm cedi.

I’ve done everything wrong the first time so you don’t have to. Trust me, I’m an engineer.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [@Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) Azure.
I am interested in distributed systems, site reliability engineering, and just generally working at large scale.

I am involved in somme stuff at the Chaos Computer Club where I led the Network Team at GPN for two years and I help with the builtup, planning, and a million other things at various events trough the year, most notably the Chaos Communication Congress at the end of every year.
During the pandemic - when the in-person events where unable to happen - I helped to build online services like [jitsi.rocks](https://jitsi.rocks/), open-infrastructure, or the [rC3 - NOW HERE](https://rc3.world/2021/).

In my sparetime I love playing around with Kubernetes, Raspberry Pis, and various other technologies.
I have a small Cluster of Pis at home, running K3s. I also have [KubeOne](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone) cluster running in the [Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud), which I use to explore more about Kubernetes.

I’m also a passionate photographer and have a small collection of analog cameras in 35mm as well as 120 medium format which include a Leica M6 and a Hasselblad 500 c/m.
What makes my analoge photography even more fun is, that I develop my film myself at home where I have a small dark-room and even a enlarger for 35mm film.

## What's important to me?

* Be excellent to each other
* Follow the [80/20 principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) whenever possible
  * Don't waste 80% of your time, implementing the top 20% when the customer is already happy with the 80% you delivered in 20% of your time
* Focus on the fundamentals rather than fancy cutting-edge stuff
* Get your good damn service reliability hierarchy right
  * Don't waste time implementing fancy features when the lower part of your pyramid can't support it

* Alert on symtoms rather than vitals
* There is no singular root-cause to your incidents
  * complex systems fail in a complex way
  * [How Complex Systems Fail](https://how.complexsystems.fail)
* Your beloved "system" or "infrastructure" only exists in your head!
  * Even if it is documented - the documentation will be outdated sooner than you think
  * Your fellow engineers might have an entirely different mental-model of how the system works and why it behaves the way it does
  * See [the above-the-line/below-the-line framework](https://snafucatchers.github.io/#2_3_The_above-the-line/below-the-line_framework)

* Incidents are good!
  * Incidents gauge the delta between how you imagened your systems behaves versus how it actually works
