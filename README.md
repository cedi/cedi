Hi, I'm cedi.

I’ve done everything wrong the first time so you don’t have to. Trust me, I’m an engineer.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [@Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) Azure.
I am interested in distributed systems, site reliability engineering, and just generally working at large scale.

I am involved in somme stuff at the Chaos Computer Club where I led the Network Team at GPN for two years and I help with the builtup, planning, and a million other things at various events trough the year, most notably the Chaos Communication Congress at the end of every year.
During the pandemic - when the in-person events where unable to happen - I helped to build online services like [jitsi.rocks](https://jitsi.rocks/), open-infrastructure, or the [rC3 - NOW HERE](https://rc3.world/2021/).

In my sparetime I love playing around with Kubernetes, Raspberry Pis, and various other technologies.
I have a small Cluster of Pis at home, running K3s. I also have [KubeOne](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone) cluster running in the [Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud), which I use to explore more about Kubernetes.

I’m also a passionate photographer and have a small collection of analog cameras in 35mm as well as 120 medium format which include a Leica M6 and a Hasselblad 500 c/m.
What makes my analoge photography even more fun is, that I develop my film myself at home where I have a small dark-room and even a enlarger for 35mm film.

## What's important to me?

* Be excellent to each other
* Focus on the fundamentals rather than fancy cutting-edge stuff
* Get your good damn service reliability hierarchy right

* Alert on symtoms rather than vitals
* There is no singular root-cause to your incidents - complex systems fail in a complex way
  * [How Complex Systems Fail](https://how.complexsystems.fail)
* Your beloved "system" or "infrastructure" only exists in your head!

* Incidents are a good thing! They gauge the delta between how you imagened your systems behaves versus how it actually works
