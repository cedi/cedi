## 👋 Cedric Kienzler — @cedi

Hi, I'm Cedric — but most people know me as *cedi*.

I'm a **Senior Site Reliability Engineering and Tech Lead** at [Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/microsoft), working on **distributed systems, chaos engineering, and platform resilience** at scale.  
If it's complex, distributed, and needs to stay up — I'm into it.

---

### 🔧 What I Do

- Building reliable, large-scale systems with a focus on **resilience, SLOs, and automation**
- Leading teams and setting technical direction in high-stakes, high-scale environments
- Designing chaos experiments, improving release workflows, and modernizing infrastructure
- Evangelizing good SRE practices through talks, docs, and community work

---

### 🧪 What I Tinker With

- Home lab with **Raspberry Pi K3s cluster**, **CEPH storage**, and a **Stratum 1 NTP/PTP time server**
- **Cluster API** managed cloud Kubernetes cluster running a full **Grafana LGTM Stack**
- Kernel recompilation just for fun (and for weird hardware drivers)
- Low-level **distributed systems** algorithms to explore gossip and consensus protocols

---

### 💡 Things I Believe in

- Be excellent to each other 🤝
- Focus on fundamentals > chasing hype
- Alert on **symptoms**, not **vitals**
- Incidents are opportunities to learn
- There is no single "root cause"
- [How Complex Systems Fail](https://how.complexsystems.fail) is required reading  
- Your beloved system architecture exists mostly **in your head** and ~~behaves~~ fails differently than you'd expect. (See the [Above the line/below the line](https://snafucatchers.github.io/#2_3_The_above-the-line/below-the-line_framework) framework)
